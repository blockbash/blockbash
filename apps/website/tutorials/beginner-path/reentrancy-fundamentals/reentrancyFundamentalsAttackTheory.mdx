## Introduction

- Reentrancy is a smart contract vulnerability that allows the attacker the ability to invoke the vulnerable contract in an unexpected state. As you'll see in
<LinkAnchor anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.processDiagram}/>, `Attacker` Contract will unexpectedly call (or "re-enter") the `Vulnerable` Contract before the `Vulnerable` Contract has updated its state.
- In this lesson, you'll learn the theory behind Reentrancy attacks. After you've learned the theory, you'll create your own `Attacker` Contract and exploit this vulnerability within the lab environment!
- <InlineTip label={"Tip"}/> Do you already have a grasp on how Reentrancy works?  Feel free to move to the <LinkTutorial tutorialGUID={tutorialConfigConst.TutorialGUID.reentrancyFundamentalsAttackLab}/> and put your knowledge to the test!

## Prerequisites

- Basic Solidity knowledge

## Code {#primaryCode}
- The code in this section is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack. In the
<LinkTutorial tutorialGUID={tutorialConfigConst.TutorialGUID.reentrancyFundamentalsAttackLab}/>, you'll create an `Attacker` Contract that exploits this bug.

<SectionWrapper>
    <CodePanelTipProcessDiagram tutorialGUID={tutorialConfigConst.TutorialGUID.reentrancyFundamentalsAttackTheory}/>
    <CodePanel>
        <>
            ```solidity collapse={1 - 13} {"1":14} {"2":25} {"3":28} {"4":31} {"5":33} title=Vulnerable.sol file=./contracts/reentrancy-fundamentals/Vulnerable.sol
            ```
        </>
    </CodePanel>
</SectionWrapper>

### Explanation
- <CodeFootnote anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.primaryCode} type={'reg'}>1</CodeFootnote> : Before exploiting the Reentrancy vulnerability, the `Attacker` Contract must complete some prerequisite work. In this case, `deposit()` is called to give the attacker a positive balance.  (The reasoning for this step will be evident soon.)
- <CodeFootnote anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.primaryCode} type={'reg'}>2</CodeFootnote>: The `Attacker` Contract calls `withdrawAll()` to start the main portion of the attack.
- <CodeFootnote anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.primaryCode} type={'reg'}>3</CodeFootnote>: This condition passes due to <CodeFootnote anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.primaryCode} type={'reg'}>1</CodeFootnote>.
- <CodeFootnote anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.primaryCode} type={'reg'}>4</CodeFootnote>
    - `msg.sender` refers to the address that called `withdrawAll()`. For the purposes of this example, we'll refer to this as `attacker_address`.
    - When `attacker_address` initially calls `withdrawAll()`, `beginExecutionBalance` is equal to the amount of `ETH` that `attacker_address` initially deposited into the contract.
    - `call()` is a low-level Solidity function that can send `ETH` to another address.  When this `call()` occurs, the execution flow is delegated to the `Attacker` Contract which allows the `Attacker` Contract to call `withdrawAll()` again.  This second `withdrawAll()` occurs before the state update (<CodeFootnote anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.primaryCode} type={'reg'}>5</CodeFootnote>) occurs.  As the `Vulnerable` Contract can be "re-entered" before it updates its state, `Vulnerable` Contract is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack.  When the `Attacker` Contract calls `withdrawAll()` for the second time,
<CodeFootnote anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.primaryCode} type={'reg'}>3</CodeFootnote> will evaluate to `false` as `beginExecutionBalance` hasn't (yet) been set to `0`. During the second `call()`, the `Attacker` Contract will receive more `ETH` than they deposited into the contract.  If this process continued, the `Attacker` Contract could bankrupt the `Vulnerable` Contract!

### Summary
- Reentrancy is like a bank withdrawal scenario where someone requests money, but before the teller updates their balance, they jump back in line to withdraw again.
- The code demonstrates **Single-Function Reentrancy**, where a single function is re-entered during the attack. As you'll see in
<LinkTutorial tutorialGUID={tutorialConfigConst.TutorialGUID.reentrancyFundamentalsDefendTheory}/>, there can be other types of Reentrancy (e.g., Cross-Function Reentrancy, Cross-Contract Reentrancy, etc.)

## Process Diagram {#processDiagram}
- In this section, you'll visualize how the `Attacker` Contract could exploit the `Vulnerable` Contract. As previously discussed, you'll create the `Attacker` Contract in the next lesson.
- <InlineWarning label={"Important"}/> The diagram is meant to give a *high-level* overview of the attack.  In other words, certain minor steps are omitted.  Learning how to complete these minor steps independently is a pivotal skill. As such, you'll practice this skill within the <LinkTutorial tutorialGUID={tutorialConfigConst.TutorialGUID.reentrancyFundamentalsAttackLab}/>.
- <InlineTip label={"Tip"}/> To solidify your understanding, try to cross-reference the `Vulnerable` Contract (in the diagram) with the <LinkAnchor anchorGUID={tutorialConfigConst.AnchorGUID.primaryCode}/>.

### Explanation

- <DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.seedingPhase}>1</DiagramFootnote>: In this example, the attack starts when `Attacker` Contract creates a balance within `Vulnerable` Contract.
- <DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.transferPhase}>2</DiagramFootnote>: Note the `Attacker` Contract balance (on the blockchain), is now 0 `ETH`.
- <DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.transferPhase}>3a</DiagramFootnote> <DiagramFootnote>3b</DiagramFootnote>: When `Attacker` Contract attempts to withdraw 1 `ETH`, the `Vulnerable` Contract checks to see if `Attacker` Contract has a positive balance.
- <DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.transferPhase}>4a</DiagramFootnote> <DiagramFootnote>4b</DiagramFootnote>: The transfer moves forward because `Attacker` Contract has 1 `ETH` available (in `Vulnerable` Contract's state).
- <DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.transferPhase}>5</DiagramFootnote>: When the developer created `Vulnerable` Contract, they assumed the contract would interact with Externally Owned Accounts (i.e., accounts that don't execute code).  In other words, they didn't expect <DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.transferPhase}>5</DiagramFootnote> to occur.  In the developer's faulty mental model, the execution flow would immediately transition to the **Deduction Phase**.  However, the third party is actually a smart contract and when one contract calls another, it's like temporarily handing over the steering wheel - the called contract gets to decide what happens next.  When the "steering wheel" is handed to the `Attacker` contract, the **Deduction Phase** hasn't occurred.
- <DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.transferPhase}>3a</DiagramFootnote>: After receiving the 1 `ETH`, the `Attacker` Contract can immediately attempt another withdrawal. In other words, the `Attacker` Contract is "re-entering" the `Vulnerable` Contract. As the **Deduction Phase** hasn't occurred, <DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.transferPhase}>3b</DiagramFootnote> will evaluate to `True` and the `Vulnerable` Contract will transfer unintended eth to the `Attacker` Contract. Unfortunately, this transfer can start the "attack loop" again (see red arrows).  The "attack loop" will continue until all eth has been transferred to the `Attacker` contract.
- <InlineTip label={"Key Takeaway"}/>: Notice how the `Vulnerable` Contract has state-changing operations (**Deduction Phase**) *after* giving execution control to the `Attacker` Contract
(
<DiagramFootnote prefix={tutorialConfigConst.DiagramConstructNames.transferPhase}>4a</DiagramFootnote>
). This is a common sign of a Reentrancy vulnerability.

## Next Steps
- In the
<LinkTutorial tutorialGUID={tutorialConfigConst.TutorialGUID.reentrancyFundamentalsAttackLab}/>, you'll create the `Attacker` Contract and get some "hands on" experience with this vulnerability!
