## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- Basic Ethereum knowledge

## Vulnerability Summary {#vuln-summary}

- Reentrancy is a smart contract vulnerability that allows the attacker (i.e., `AttackerContract`) the ability to invoke the vulnerable contract (i.e., `VulnerableContract`) in an unexpected state. In other words, when `VulnerableContract` invokes `AttackerContract`, it's possible for `AttackerContract` to immediately call (or "re-enter") the `VulnerableContract`. The vulnerability manifests when the developer doesn't expect this condition to occur.
- In the diagram (below), you'll go through logic that's vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. After you've learned the theory, you'll create your own `AttackerContract` and exploit this vulnerability within the lab environment!
