# Introduction
+ It's time for some hands-on experience!
+ {props.goal}

## Lab Options
+ There are two ways to launch the lab environment: i) Github Codespaces ii) Visual Studio Code.
+ While each option has its pros/cons, Github Codespaces option is the quickest way to get "up and running".

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="github-codespaces" label="Github Codespaces" default>
      + PROS
        + The simplest option as it runs the lab in your browser.
        + No dependencies to install.
      + CONS
        + Executes on Github's servers which can incur a cost after the free tier is exhausted. Luckily, it's easy to set a spending limit of `0` so you won't be charged once the free tier is exhausted (instructions below).
      + Prerequisites
        + Sign up for a [Github Account](https://github.com/signup)
        + **OPTIONAL**: Github will charge for Codespace usage once the free tier is exhausted. To ensure that you will never be charged, navigate to [this link](https://github.com/settings/billing/spending_limit) and ensure the `Codespace` spending limit is set to `0`.
:::warning

You must complete the Prerequisites (mentioned above) before starting the lab.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="visual-studio-code" label="Visual Studio Code">
      + PROS
        + If you're already a Visual Studio Code user, your existing extensions should work automatically (e.g., Vim).
        + As the lab isn't being executed within the browser, you'll have a more "native" experience.
        + Depending on your computer, it might be faster than the Codespace environment.
      + CONS
        + Requires dependencies to be installed (see below).
      + Prerequisites
        + Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
        + Install the [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
        + Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
          + Other container runtimes are not supported at this time.
